Create SQS Queues:
- Input queue for receiving simulation requests
- Output queue for simulation results
- Set environment variable (in lambda_handler.py for now) for OUTPUT_QUEUE_URL


Create ECR and Lambda Function:

1. Create ECR and click the "View Push Commands"
2. Build the sir-engine Dockerfile, tag, push it to new ECR
3. Create lambda from the ECR image. NOTE: Docker buildx >= 0.1.0 makes a manifest (several images). Pick the one that works :-)
4. Set lambda execution role with `AmazonSQSFullAccess` permissions
5. Configure SQS input queue as trigger


Test:

Test lambda using `sir-engine-test.json` 
Test SQS -> Lambda -> SQS pipeline by giving the input SQS the following json (simulated output from frontend):
{
    "userInputs": {
        "populationSize": 100,
        "infectionRate": 0.05,
        "numInfected": 10,
        "recoveryRate": 0.01,
        "timeStepsDays": 3
    }
}
